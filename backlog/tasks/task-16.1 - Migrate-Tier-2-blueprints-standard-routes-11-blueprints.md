## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Run the flask_to_starlette.py codemod on 11 Tier 2 blueprints and wire them into app/asgi.py. These are standard blueprints with request.json + jsonify patterns, possibly hotpatch-decorated, but no session usage.

## Blueprints (ordered roughly by complexity)
- security_ops (163 lines)
- loyalty (195 lines)
- compliance (218 lines)
- ics_ot (266 lines)
- infrastructure (269 lines)
- genai (261 lines) — **manual fix**: request.files in 2 routes
- energy_utilities (414 lines)
- telecom (448 lines)
- attack_sim (577 lines)
- government (684 lines)
- admin (730 lines)

## Process per blueprint
1. `uv run python scripts/flask_to_starlette.py app/blueprints/<name>/`
2. Manual review of output — watch for: Response() calls, abort(), send_from_directory(), make_response()
3. Edit __init__.py: `from starlette.routing import Router` → `from app.routing import DecoratorRouter as Router`
4. Remove blueprint from Flask factory (app/__init__.py imports + register_blueprint calls)
5. Add `*<name>_router.routes` to app/asgi.py routes list
6. Run `make test-ci` — Flask tests should still pass
7. Smoke test a representative endpoint via `curl` against uvicorn

## Known manual fixes
- **genai/routes.py**: `request.files` has no 1:1 Starlette equivalent. Use `await request.form()` and `.getlist()`.
- **Response() objects**: codemod imports Response but doesn't rewrite `Response(body, mimetype=...)` — use `Response(content=body, media_type=...)`.

## Reference
- Tier 1 reference commit: 990741b (shows exact pattern for main/recorder/diagnostics/throughput)

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All 11 Tier 2 blueprints transformed by codemod
- [ ] #2 DecoratorRouter used in all Tier 2 __init__.py files
- [ ] #3 Routes mounted in app/asgi.py
- [ ] #4 Flask factory no longer imports Tier 2 blueprints
- [ ] #5 genai request.files manually migrated to Starlette form API
- [ ] #6 Flask test suite passes (632 tests, allowing for Tier 1+2 shims)
- [ ] #7 Smoke test confirms representative endpoint from each blueprint works on uvicorn

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Audit Tier 2 blueprints and their existing test coverage to choose a safe first migration chunk that can move off Flask without losing verification.
2. Improve the migration pattern where needed (router shim, codemod, and/or test fixtures) so migrated routes can be exercised through the ASGI app while unmigrated routes continue using Flask.
3. Convert the first Tier 2 blueprint subset, mount those routers in app/asgi.py, remove them from app/__init__.py, and migrate their tests to the appropriate client path.
4. Verify targeted pytest coverage after each migrated blueprint group before expanding to the remaining Tier 2 set.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Migrated first Tier 2 wave into Starlette: government, telecom, and energy_utilities now mount in app/asgi.py while Flask create_app() deregisters those blueprints.

Added parallel ASGI pytest fixtures in tests/conftest.py and converted the three migrated route suites to TestClient/json() semantics so Starlette routes can be exercised without breaking remaining Flask tests.

Extended app/routing.py so the decorator shim forwards path params, preserves Flask-like static-over-dynamic route precedence, and exposes get_json_or_default() for lenient JSON parsing during migration.

Verification: cd apps/vuln-api && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_government_routes.py tests/unit/test_telecom_routes.py tests/unit/test_energy_utilities_routes.py tests/unit/test_banking_routes.py tests/unit/test_hotpatch.py tests/unit/test_routing.py -q -> 36 passed in 0.54s.

Source review receipts: .agents/reviews/review-20260414-111916.md (blocked on JSON parsing), .agents/reviews/review-20260414-112325.md (pass with issues), .agents/reviews/review-20260414-112739.md (source-only pass with issues, no P0/P1).

Test audit receipt: .agents/reviews/test-audit-20260414-113044.md. Main findings are broader missing endpoint coverage across these blueprints and helper edge cases; no regression was found in the migrated route/test slice.

Second Tier 2 Starlette wave landed for security_ops, loyalty, and compliance.\nMounted the three routers in app/asgi.py and removed direct Flask blueprint registration.\nAdded Flask compatibility mirroring for migrated Starlette routers so app.py/create_app() continues serving migrated domains during the transition.\nHardened app/routing.py with shared JSON parsing semantics, shared HTTP exception payload building, path-param signature filtering, Flask path denormalization, and combined ASGI route specificity sorting.\nRestored stricter Flask-aligned JSON behavior for migrated mutations: wrong Content-Type returns 415, malformed JSON returns 400, non-object JSON returns 400, and strict compliance routes reject missing/null bodies.\nAdded targeted Starlette route tests for security_ops, loyalty, and compliance plus Flask/ASGI parity coverage in test_migrated_flask_compat_routes.py and additional router regression coverage in test_routing.py.\nVerification: cd apps/vuln-api && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_migrated_flask_compat_routes.py tests/unit/test_security_ops_routes.py tests/unit/test_loyalty_routes.py tests/unit/test_compliance_routes.py tests/unit/test_government_routes.py tests/unit/test_telecom_routes.py tests/unit/test_energy_utilities_routes.py tests/unit/test_banking_routes.py tests/unit/test_hotpatch.py tests/unit/test_routing.py -q -> 60 passed in 1.58s\nCode review receipts: .agents/reviews/review-20260414-131942.md (holistic final review, PASS WITH ISSUES).\nSupporting review history for the remediation loop: .agents/reviews/review-20260414-124101.md, review-20260414-124653.md, review-20260414-125113.md, review-20260414-125553.md, review-20260414-125959.md, review-20260414-130334.md, review-20260414-130733.md, review-20260414-131234.md.\nTest audit receipt: .agents/reviews/test-audit-20260414-131637.md. Audit confirms parity/error-path coverage exists and calls out follow-on gaps in routing helper depth rather than a regression in this slice.

2026-04-14: Migrated the third Tier 2 Starlette wave: ics_ot and infrastructure now mount in app/asgi.py and are mirrored back into create_app() via register_flask_compat_routes instead of direct Flask blueprint registration.

Hardened app/routing.py during this wave: JSON/flask compat coercion now preserves ASGI content-type for Flask get_json(), reuses a shared Flask response builder for non-streaming and streaming responses, parses compat JSON bodies directly from raw request bytes, and exposes basic request.url surface on the Flask adapter.

Added targeted coverage in tests/unit/test_ics_ot_routes.py, tests/unit/test_infrastructure_routes.py, tests/unit/test_migrated_flask_compat_routes.py, and tests/unit/test_routing.py including Flask-vs-ASGI JSON parity, streaming-response compatibility, request.url adapter coverage, and direct proof that get_json_or_default matches current Flask 3 request.get_json() behavior for missing content-type, malformed JSON, null JSON, and valid objects.

Verification: cd apps/vuln-api && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_ics_ot_routes.py tests/unit/test_infrastructure_routes.py tests/unit/test_migrated_flask_compat_routes.py tests/unit/test_security_ops_routes.py tests/unit/test_loyalty_routes.py tests/unit/test_compliance_routes.py tests/unit/test_government_routes.py tests/unit/test_telecom_routes.py tests/unit/test_energy_utilities_routes.py tests/unit/test_banking_routes.py tests/unit/test_hotpatch.py tests/unit/test_routing.py -q -> 78 passed in 1.87s.

Source review artifacts: .agents/reviews/review-20260414-141735.md, .agents/reviews/review-20260414-142249.md, .agents/reviews/review-20260414-143018.md, .agents/reviews/review-20260414-143446.md. The final review remained BLOCKED on a Flask get_json semantics assumption contradicted by a live Flask 3 probe plus the new parity regression test in tests/unit/test_routing.py.

Test audit artifact: .agents/reviews/test-audit-20260414-143935.md. Report is broader missing endpoint coverage for existing migrated domains, not a regression in the ics_ot/infrastructure slice.
